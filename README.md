# Solarplex Manifesto
__Hackernews for Solana. An open decentralized forum for the Solana community.__

## Genesis
The idea for this community was sparked by the @usedispatch team along with a few twitter discussions.

## Goal
- The goal of Solarplex is to be a hacker news style community for solana (and ideally the broader crypto ecosystem). A community curated news and discussions site. This site will be built on the @usedispatch forums protocol.
- A second goal is to be a central resource for solana community documentation and discussions.
