# Resources and documentation

## What resources are missing on Solana?

- A community for product managers like LamportDAO is for Devs
- Product design for crypto
- Protocol design documentation
- Good beginner docs, but nothing for mid level to advanced
- Youtube videos with explainers and context
- Hard to search youtube videos especially since results are spammy and ad dominated
- Documents for non crypto natives to onboard them
- On the content side for product builders: data and analytics pieces

## Product Design
- better ux for frequent wallet txns
- infra for caching and retrying chain txns
- wallet based access control for resources
- identity and pfp solutions
- non financial chain uses
- no-code platform to enable IRL businesses to deploy a loyalty reward program using Solana Pay


## Protocol Design
- what is a protocol?
- interface design
- immutable vs mutable
- token or not
- space / time usage
- oracles
- external storage
- authentication and access control
- security and review best practices
- off-chain crankers
- non-custodial vs custodial staking.

## Licenses and open source ethos
- what license should I use?
- differences between open source and source open?
- explanation of licenses
- why should I open source my code (or not)?
- does open source mean unsafe / exploitable?
- how would I make money with open source code?
